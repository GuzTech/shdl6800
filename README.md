shdl6800
============
This is a [SpinalHDL](https://github.com/SpinalHDL/SpinalHDL) reimplementation of [Robert Baruch's 6800 processor implementation](https://github.com/RobertBaruch/n6800) written in [nMigen](https://github.com/m-labs/nmigen).

Robert also posts videos about the implementation, which you can find on his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBcljXmuXPok9kT_VGA3adg). 

## Why?

I am experimenting with several different hardware description languages, and nMigen (combined with the [LiteX toolbox](https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex)) looks really good.
I also have some experience with SpinalHDL, and while watching his videos, it looked surprisingly similar to how you would implement it in SpinalHDL. This reimplementation is just to see how similar it can be to his implementation.

## Status

As of this writing, I have somewhat caught up with [Part 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLQqOxnVMOQ), but I have not implemented the formal verification part yet.
